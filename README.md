CS269Q Final Project

Michal Adamkiewicz, Jorge Cueto, Kent Vainio

TO DO:
- [ ] Implement inefficient, 100% reliable tomography system
- [ ] Decide on more efficient, less reliable system
- [ ] Implement the chosen system
- [ ] Create debugging interface
- [ ] Maybe implement a second tomography algorithm depending on how things are going?
